## Project Description

This project investigates whether **sunlight requirement** is associated with **water requirement** in edible plant species. Using observational data on 140 plant species, the analysis applies a chi-square test of independence and Fisher's Exact Test to evaluate this ecological relationship.

**Key finding:** No statistically significant association was detected between sunlight and water requirements (chi-squared(4) = 4.35, p = 0.36; Fisher's p = 0.34), though the small sample size in shade-tolerant species limits interpretability.

## Data Source

- **Dataset:** edible_plants (TidyTuesday, 2026-02-03)
- **URL:** https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2026/2026-02-03/edible_plants.csv
- **Description:** Observational records on 140 edible plant species including sunlight requirements, water requirements, and other cultivation characteristics.

## How to Reproduce the Analysis

### Requirements

- R (>= 4.0)
- RStudio (recommended for knitting)
- R packages: `tidyverse`, `knitr`

Install packages if needed:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "knitr"))
```

### Steps

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ncp46-coder/VTPEH6270-Naiya.git
   ```

2. Open RStudio and set your working directory to the cloned folder.

3. Place `edible_plants.csv` in the `Data/` folder (or update the `setwd()` path in the Rmd file to match your local path).

4. Open `Final_Report/FinalReport.Rmd` and click **Knit** to reproduce the PDF.

> **Note:** The `setwd()` path in the Rmd files is set to the author's local machine. Update it to your own path before knitting.

## Shiny App

An interactive data explorer for the edible_plants dataset is available in the `ShinyApp/` folder.

To run locally:

```r
library(shiny)
shiny::runApp("ShinyApp/app.R")
```

## Checkpoint Overview

| Checkpoint | Topic | Key Method |
|------------|-------|------------|
| CP02 | Data Exploration | Summary statistics, initial visualization |
| CP04 | Data Visualization | ggplot2 figures |
| CP06 | Statistical Analyses | Chi-square test, Fisher's Exact Test |
| CP07 | *(topic)* | *(method)* |
| Final Report | Sunlight vs. Water Requirements | Chi-square + Fisher's Exact Test |
